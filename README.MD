### How I'll scale it
Based on the codebase (Node.js backend with Socket.IO, MongoDB, and multi-tenant architecture), here's how I'd scale it: I'd start by putting a load balancer in front and running multiple server instances, then add Redis for session management and Socket.IO communication between servers. I'd  add proper indexing on tenant IDs, and cache frequently accessed data like tenant configs. For heavy operations, I'd implement a background job queue to keep the API responsive. The quick wins I'd tackle first are adding pagination to all endpoints, implementing rate limiting per tenant, and optimizing database queries. These simple changes usually buy several months of growth before needing more complex microservices architecture or infrastructure investments.
